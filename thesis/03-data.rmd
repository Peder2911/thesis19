# Data 

The seemingly simple act of description in itself is perhaps understudied; some
have even argued that the important process of data generation is one of the
least developed skills in social science [@singer_variables_1982Â 212]. While
developing theories and formalizations of "mere observation" might not be the
most salient of activities for social scientists, it is, arguably, the
framework on which empirical study rests.

Being precise about what measurement is, how it is done, and what challenges
are inherent in it, also makes it easier to see favourable similarities with
processes such as statistical learning. This link is the foundation for the
work presented here: The purpose of this chapter is to establish the
theoretical background of the system that is presented in the subsequent
chapters. By first describing what data is, and how it is made, I establish
several formalizations that are used in the following chapters to describe a
how computers can be applied to generated structured data.

While this chapter focuses on the basic definitions of data creation, the next
chapter describes a specific process of coding data about ceasefires from
newspaper data. While @holsti_content_1969 [94] emphasizes the importance of
referencing some specific research question when discussing data creation
methodology, I will nevertheless first attempt some nonspecific definitions of
data, and the process of creating data, to ground the following discussion. 

I will attempt to give some formal definitions of the component processes of
data making, that will facilitate a structured discussion of the various kinds
of data quality. The term "data quality" covers several aspects of how the
data relates to the real world, and makes it possible to assess and compare
different ways of producing data using a common standard. High quality is
always desirable, but is very often difficult to attain. The core of my
argument, and the motivation behind the work presented in the following
chapters, is that the application of computers in data-creation makes it
possible to maintain data quality while producing large amounts of data. 

The nontrivial factor of cost is also a major driving factor behind
automatization of processes in data collection. It was made clear in the
previous chapter that important phenomena are also "data scarce", which
prevents further study. This is in no small part due to the fact that the
collection of high-quality data can be incredibly expensive and time-consuming.
This makes the effectivization of data-collection a prerequisite for further
development of theory and knowledge.

## Definitions

A datum is essentially just a statement of something that was: An existential
statement that refers to some state, condition or event that has existed
@singer_variables_1982. Datum is a Latin word, which originally means "a
given". Data can thus be interpreted as "what is given" for an analysis, or
rather, what is taken to be true; the premise for an argument. In this broad
sense, any kind of perception or record, ephemeral or permanent, is data. Data
is synonymous with information; perceived and recorded bits that refer to some
fact, notion or state. 

Reality, however, is an intractable mass of information, and the world is full
of an infinite number of facts. When seeking knowledge about some particular
phenomenon, it becomes necessary to make judgments about data relevance, to
seek the "signal" in the "sea of noise" [@singer_variables_1982 196]. This is
called selection, and is the first of two necessary steps
[@singer_data-making_1965 69] from "raw" to structured data. 

The next step is classification, or structured comprehension of the signal
observations. In a sense, this is also a kind of selection process, as it
involves choosing the set of _attributes_ that will represent the phenomena:
Once what we want to study has been defined, we also need to decide what it is
about our objects of study that is relevant. A "data language", which denotes
the relevant attributes and their significance, is the "Rosetta Stone" that
mediates between the unstructured matter of raw observation and the structured
matter of data [@krippendorff_content_2004 150]. 

When combined, selection and classification of raw information creates
structured data; a collection of bits of information that are curated and
recorded according to a given set of procedures. This is a simplifying act
[@king_designing_1994 42]; some information is emphasized while the rest is
discarded. This discrimination between signal and noise is one of the most
difficult tasks in social science (ibid.). 

The virtue of simplification, however, is that it facilitates analysis: Since
the same procedures for structuring observations are applied to multiple cases,
the resultant values can be compared in many useful ways. Data is purportedly
connected to the world of concepts, and allows for structured reasoning, the
testing of hypotheses and the observation of patterns relevant to the
development of theory. 

However, the "conceptual screening" [@singer_data-making_1965 69] that is
performed on raw information to produce data is certainly not neutral, a fact
that in any case warrants critical assessment of data. Data should always be
thought of as something more than mere facts: It is rather a combination of
facts and scheme [@krippendorff_content_2004 81]. This means that auditing
data, in terms of truthfulness and usefulness, is only possible through a
detailed understanding of the scheme that links facts to structured data.

### Data structure

Selected and classified observation make structured data: Information that has
been registered according to a predetermined set of criteria. This is also a
rather broad definition however; for the sake of simplicity, I will follow an
influential definition of structured data that is more specific. This
definition is attributed to @codd_relational_1970: Through what is termed the
relational model, or relational theory [@date_database_2001 5] of data, it is
possible to define some basic properties and traits of structured data that
serve as a practical foundation for further discussion. 

The relational model states that structured data are organized into relations,
which might also be called tables. A relation has columns, which
@codd_relational_1970 also call domains, and rows. Rows are distinct tuples
containing one value from each domain. Importantly, columns hold a single
significance, or meaning, representing some category or kind of information. 
 
What is useful about Codds relational model of data, is that it emphasizes the
relatedness of the observations _through_ the information contained in the
columns. This means that rows can be compared as similar but distinct instances
having values in the same domains, meaning that they hold some value of
information in the same categories, or rather, variables. The assumption of
comparability and structured difference in terms of the variables makes the
rows comparable: The relational data structure is a structure that, by design,
facilitates comparative analysis. 

The way in which the relational model facilitates analysis is clearer in the
later specification of "Tidy data" [@wickham_tidy_2014], a special case of
relational data that is further designed to easily yield itself to analysis.
Tidy data is summarized through three principles that form a standard for how
the semantics and the structure of data should be related (ibid. 4): 

1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

The idea that observations can be seen as related through their traits requires
an assumption of relatedness and difference. The segregation of observational
units into separate tables (3) depends on the assumption of difference between
the units, and the collection of values under a single given variable column
(2) depends on the assumption of equality of the values in terms of the
dimension that they express. In other words, the units are distinct, but
comparable.

The reason for committing to this narrow model is analyzability, as
Analyzability might be said to be the main motivation behind the difficult and
costly enterprise of data-making in the first place [@krippendorff_content_2004
146]. While other kinds of structures, such as graphs or dictionaries are also
analyzable, the readily analyzable form of unit-tables where the units can be
compared in terms of a given set of variables is a useful ideal model to aim
for when determining how the data should be structured before collection can
begin. This makes the tidy model a useful point of reference when discussing
both the merit, and the techniques of structuring data: While there are many
kinds of structured data, I will only refer to the "tidy" tabular form in this
thesis.

## Making data 

Scientific observation is, perhaps most of all, defined by systematicity. This
is what sets data coding apart from "mere" observation. Coding, or
"data-making" is thus defined as the application of rules to a set of
observations. Furthermore, understanding the set of rules and the way they were
applied is key to be able to reason about data. 

Reasoning about data requires an understanding of both raw material, and the
rules with which it was made. While a discussion of the raw information that is
structured is specific to each data-gathering effort, data gathering schemes
can be discussed more generally. Data creation can refer to a wide variety of
methods, with the common element that information is recorded in some
structured, predetermined way. The method applied in the following chapters is
Content Analysis, defined as the systematic comprehension of _text_ according
to a given procedure [@holsti_content_1969 5], but the terms and procedures
discussed here are not exclusive to the analysis of text. 

@adcock_measurement_2001 [530] discusses the relationship between concepts and
observations in terms of four levels: From "background concept" to the
application of indicators. These levels are linked by corresponding tasks, which 
link the world of concepts with empirical referents. Data making is the
traversal of these levels in terms of the tasks: Conceptualization,
operationalization, and scoring.

Conceptualization is a systematic formulation of some concept of interest
(ibid. 529): The researcher starts with an interest in a "background concept"
or domain, and must develop some systematic idea about how the concept is
manifested in the form of empirical fact. Indeed, we must start with some idea
of what we want to explain [@king_designing_1994 51], because we need to be
able to discern between relevant and irrelevant facts about the objects we are
looking at. This means that data collection is likely tied to the development
of some theory about a concept or phenomenon of interest. 

The outcome of data-making is the result of several acts that depend on prior
assumptions; both the conceptualization and operationalization that define how
the data relates to the realm of theory. While this is an inevitable fact
about any kind of data; it must be handled cognizantly by those who admit the
data in their analyses.

The codebook, instructions, coding guide or computer program used to process
the raw information connects structured and unstructured data; linking the
phenomena and the theoretical backdrop in which the data is framed. The
creation of data starts with the definition of this material. Central elements
are how the coding categories are defined, what the units of analysis are, and
how the units will map to these to the categories [@holsti_content_1969 94].
This must all be established a-priori, before structured observations can be
recorded [@neuendorf_content_2017 18].

### Truth and data 

When discussing methodology, it is essential that key terms are disambiguated
[@gerring_case_2008 19]. A potentially confusing term when discussing the
process of data-making is "true". What might be helpful, is to discern between
the "kinds" of truth attainable through measurement: 

The truth of some measuring procedure, given operationalization, or "test", is
defined as the outcome of such a procedure administered to a given case exempt
random errors of measurement [@allen_introduction_1979 57]. This truth is
expressed by the concept of _reliability_. Deviations from this first truth
are called "errors of measurement", and are assumed to be unsystematic. In this
thesis, I will refer to this kind of "truth" as small $t$:

\begin{align*}
e &:= error \\ 
m &:= measurement \\
m &= t + e 
\end{align*}

The _ideal truth_ of the background concept, on the other hand, is what we
approximate when we are conceptualizing, and reasoning about how and why to
collect data [@adcock_measurement_2001 531]. How this kind of truth should be
assessed, or even if there is such a thing as "ideal truths" about background
concepts, are rather abstract questions which I will not go deeper into here:
It should be said, however, that the collection of data is moot without
properly defined analytical constructs [@krippendorff_content_2004 89].

A third kind of truth in measurement might also be defined, relating to the
term _validity_. Valid measurement means that each measure accurately reflects
the concept as defined, or rather, that we are measuring what we are trying to
measure [@adcock_measurement_2001 529]. In this sense, true measurements are
not only free from random error, but are also a correct representation of the
concept as defined. 

The stages of truth might be thought of as hierarchical: It is not possible to
attain a true measurement of a concept as it is operationalized, without
attaining the truth of that operationalization. Similarly, it is not
reasonable to think that one can approach the "real "truth of some concept as
it actually is, without being able to measure correctly according to how it is
understood. Put technically: Reliability is antecedent to validity, and
validity is antecedent to "proper" understanding. 

Holding the different kinds of discussion about the "truth" of a measurement
separate is practical, as it also makes it possible to keep separate the
discussion of validity, reliability, and the more foundational, philosophical
arguments about the understanding of phenomena. Only the first two subjects are
approached here.

### Data quality

Considering the difficulty inherent in relating data to the truth of both a
measurement procedure, and the intended concept, it should be clear that
data-making is a process that involves both practical and conceptual
challenges. Producing high-quality data, especially at scale, requires that
much attention is put into developing the procedures and rules to be applied.
Ensuring valid and reliable measurement is just as important as being able to
produce data at scale: Without sound measurement, "big data" is nothing more
than useless noise. 

With more and more data being made available through the internet, being able
to discern between good and bad data is of great importance
[@simmhan_survey_2005]. Bad data corrupts and analysis or comprehension of it
with false knowledge, yielding seemingly credible falsities. These "fake views"
of the world are much more dangerous than other kinds of falsities in that they
seem credible, and might yield themselves to statistical analysis that provides
great rhetorical weight. "Cascading errors" is a term used by
@chojnacki_event_2012 to warn against the propagation of poor inferential
quality from data to analysis. 

Put simply; if the instructions are not public and explicit, the data cannot be
admitted to an analysis with any degree of confidence [@singer_wages_1972 14].
If a researcher unwittingly admits data with errors, such as incorrect
operationalizations, these errors "cascade", also affecting the result of any
subsequent analysis [@chojnacki_event_2012 384].

Therefore, the single most important rule for data collection is to be diligent
in recording details about the process and reasoning behind it, and to publish
these details along with the data [@king_designing_1994 51]. In fact, one might
argue that the very idea of research "presupposes explicitness"
[@krippendorff_content_2004 81]. 

With open procedures, it is possible to carefully assess the quality of data.
Data quality is often discussed using two key terms: Validity and Reliability.
Together, the two measures are an expression of how well the data reflects
whatever concept or idea. Valid and reliable data is data that accurately and
reliably represents what it is purported to represent, and a prerequisite for
any further meaningful analysis. 

### Measurement

Once the units of analysis and their attributes have been defined, and the
schema of the data has been established, the process of data-making is a
process of _measurement_. The term measurement covers the steps of
_operationalization_ and _scoring_ [@adcock_measurement_2001 530]. 

The classic definition of measurement is that it is "assignment of numerals to
objects or events according to rules" [@stevens_theory_1946 677]. While the
term "numeral" might seem equivalent to "number", it might also simply mean
"symbol" [@kerlinger_foundations_1973 427]: A numeral might hold quantitative
meaning as a number, but can also simply serve as a label, like the numbering
of football-players or billiard balls. Thus, measurement can either be
a process of labelling or quantifying some phenomenon; the core process of data
collection.

Measurement is a structured process, which is done according to a scale, which
must be defined in advance. This means that what is observable is pre-defined
as a "range"; a space of possible outcomes. Measurement, then, is a process of
mapping a set of observations, termed the domain of the measurement, to this
range, according to some given procedure, or "rule"
[@kerlinger_foundations_1973 428].

Measurement is analogous to the application of a function; the rule is a
function of the observations, and produces a given range of outcomes. Firstly,
$A$ is defined as a given range, or "scale" in which the measurements will
fall, or rather, the range of possible measurements as defined by the
measurement scheme. $I$ is a set of $n$Â length, $i_1...i_n$,Â that contain the
attributes of a unit $u$. $f$ is a rule for mapping these elements to the scale
$A$: 

\begin{align}
t_u &= f(I_u) \label{measurement}\\
t &\in A \label{range}\\
f(I_u): I_u &\to A \label{mapping}
\end{align}

When talking about "real world" measurement, however, an important addition is
needed to complete this formalization. A given measurement will, in any case,
contain stochastic error, or $e$ [@kerlinger_foundations_1973 446]. The error
term, contains any kind of disagreement between what "should" have been
measured, according to the rules of the measurement procedure, and what was
actually measured. A more realistic formalization of the process, then, is:

\begin{align}
g(I_u) &= f(I_u) + e\label{errorFunc}\\
m_u &= g(I_u)\label{errMeasure}\\
m_u &\in B\label{errRange}\\
g(I_u): I &\to B\label{errMap}
\end{align}

The function $g$ includes an error term, while the range of outcomes of $g$,
$B$ is a subset of the range of "true" outcomes on the scale $A$, meaning that
the error term cannot make the score exceed the scale. 

The properties of $e$ under classical true score theory
[@allen_introduction_1979 56] are:

\begin{align}
E(e) &= 0\label{expError}
\end{align}

Which means that the expected, or mean value of $e$ is zero, and thus that the
expected value of $m$ is $f(I)$ (\ref{tst2}) [@allen_introduction_1979Â 57].
This means that the measurement will, despite some variation, be a reasonable
approximation of what we are trying to measure. 

Whether this assumption holds for a given scheme, however, is an important
question: Whether what we are trying to measure is actually what we are
purporting to measure relates to the validity of the procedure.

#### Indication 

What is measurement performed on, or rather, what does the set $I$ contain? The
question of what we actually observe when we attempt to measure some concept
relates to the idea of indication, and a discussion of what validity and
reliability is, and how to achieve them, starts with an account of how
measurements relate to, or rather indicate the concepts we are trying to
measure. 

In general, we can say that measurement necessarily involves some kind of
instrumentation, or medium. The distance between the observer and the observed
phenomenon can vary greatly; from measuring the current temperature through a
wall thermometer to measuring the level of discontent among the Russian working
class in 1916, or the number of casualties that occurred during the battle of
the Somme. Obviously, the latter measurements are a great deal further removed
from the actual phenomenon that is measured, than the former. 

Whatever the distance, however, measurement is always done through indication;
the observation of phenomena thought to be associated with the actual
phenomenon of interest [@kerlinger_foundations_1973 431]. While temperature
might be the object of a measurement when using an old thermometer, it is not
directly observed; only indicated by the expansion and contraction of
quicksilver, which is known to be correlated with temperature. Similarly, the
phenomenon of war might be thought to be indicated by a given number of battle
deaths, as is the case for the UCDP armed conflict data set
[@gleditsch_armed_2002].

The activities, or "operations" deemed necessary and sufficient for observing a
sought concept is called the "operationalization" of that concept
[@kerlinger_foundations_1973 432]. The operationalization is related to the set
$I$. Importantly, a concept can usually be operationalized in various ways, and
the various operationalizations might vary both in their precision and
reliability, but also in their accessibility and practicality. 

#### Validity

The way data relates through real phenomena is through the "bridging" concept
of indication. In this view, data is a bridge between an observed phenomena and
the purported concept through an indicator. If the indication is sound, the
measurement is "valid", meaning that we are actually measuring what we are
trying to measure [@adcock_measurement_2001 529]. The term validity can be
thought of as the soundness of the bridge between the observed phenomenon, and
the referent world of concepts that we are seeking to observe
[@singer_variables_1982 191].


The argument that a given indicator and operationalization is a good, or
"valid" way of producing measurements of some concept must be thorough, and
this is increasingly important the further away from the object the observer
is. Like all other causal relationships, indication is hypothetical, a process
of _inferring_ from indicators to concept [@adcock_measurement_2001 531]. The
argument behind the choice of operationalization must be sound, as it is the
foundation of the validity of the data. Evidence put forth to support this
hypothetical relationship between scores and indicators must be made clear. 

A correspondence between a given measurement procedure and the "real" truth
about some concept is termed the "isomorphism" between the procedure and
reality [@kerlinger_foundations_1973 431]. Interestingly, this trait is not a
part of the formal definition of measurement. Measurement without any
assumptions about the truth value of the scores, as in \ref{expError}, is
simply a "game", its rules are only that some class of phenomenon should be
mechanically mapped to a range of outcomes. Whether the game is played with
rules that make sense in the real world is an entirely different question
(ibid.), but it is of course of the utmost importance when making sense of the
data. 

When developing an operationalization, a balance must be struck between being
specific and accurate, and including enough relevant cases
[@sundberg_systematic_2011 92]. There is always a tension between being too
specific and too general. While the former means omitting cases, the latter
means including too much. 

The degree to which an operationalization is conceptually sensible is not
easily verified. How can we be sure that a measurement procedure is
well-defined, that $f(I)$ is a sound enough bridge between indicators and
concept? In other words, how can we be sure that we are measuring what we are
purportedly measuring, and producing valid data? 

A way of reasoning about validity is through comparison with other measures. So
called a measure can be validated by criterion, or rather, by comparison with
some other, purportedly related concept [@allen_introduction_1979 97]. Given a
set of measurements $M'$ and $M''$, that supposedly measure the same thing, but
are created using different measuring procedures, the variance of the two sets
can be thought of as being composed by two component variances, $co$ and $sp.
The _common_ variance $co$Â is the variance that is caused by a conceptual
commonality between the measures, while the _specific_ variance $sp$ is
specific to each measurement procedure [@kerlinger_foundations_1973 470]. A
theoretical measure of validity, $Val$, is then defined as:

\begin{align}
Val &= \frac{co}{co + sp} \label{validityCoef}
\end{align}

This measure can be reasonably approximated by comparing $M'$ and $M''$. While
such a comparison might be a reasonable, indeed compelling piece of evidence
for the validity of some measure, especially given an established and trusted
criterion measurement procedure [@adcock_measurement_2001 537], it is, of
course, not necessarily sufficient: Like all hypotheses, validity must be
thoroughly and exhaustively argued, and can never be decisively proven. Laying
bare the argumentation is necessary to enable conscious use of the data, again
emphasizing the importance of openness.

#### Reliability 

While considering validity is complex, indeed philosophical, Reliability is
more easily estimated. The "reliability" of data is a measure of the extent to
which repeated generation of the data using a given procedure would yield the
same results. Although reliability is conceptually "simpler", it is antecedent
to validity. A discussion of validity is moot without sufficient reliability:
This is because validity is concerned with the conceptual meaning of $f(I)$ in
\ref{tst1}, and if $e$ dominates $f$ in \ref{errorFunc}, validity is moot. An
associational measure of reliability [@allen_introduction_1979 73] can be
defined as:

\begin{align}
\rho^2_{mt} \label{rel1}
\end{align}

Errors made in performing the measurement, recording the results, or during
other related procedures generate $e$ â error â and thus weaken the correlation
between what "would have been" the score from the test proper, exempt these
errors. Of course, the true score is not observable in itself. If it was, we
would have simply used that for our measurement and avoided the $e$. In
practice, however, we must assume that our measurements always contain some
error. Further paraphrasing the definition of measurement within the framework
of classical true score theory (ibid.), we expand the formalization with the
following:

\begin{align}
E(m) &= g(I) \label{tst1}\\
E(e) &= 0 \label{tst2}\\
\rho_{em} &= 0 \label{tst3}\\
\rho_{e_1e_2} &= 0 \label{tst4}\\
\rho_{e_1m_2} &= 0 \label{tst5}
\end{align}

These are assumptions about how the measured true score relates to the other
terms [@allen_introduction_1979 73]. \ref{tst1} states that the expected value
of a measurement is the result of the measurement procedure, and that the
expected error is 0 \ref{tst2}. 

This is not the same as saying that the expected error is small, only that its
mean value will be 0; $Var(e)$, the magnitude of error, cannot be assumed to be
small or big. Assumption \ref{tst2} does make it clear, however, that the true
score $t_u$ can theoretically be uncovered as the mean of an infinite number of
independent, parallel measurements. 

What generates random error, or rather, deviation from the procedure $f$? In
practice, scores will be reliable if the collection is done strictly and
precisely according to the rules laid out beforehand. Put formally, this would
mean that $f(I)$ is followed strictly in \ref{measurement}, without admitting
any additional variance. 

Reliability increases or decreases as a function of the complexity of the
coding rules, and the vagueness of the phenomenon being measured
[@sundberg_systematic_2011 99]. Simply put; the easier it is to measure a
variable correctly, the more reliable measures will be attained. Reliability
is affected by the "clarity, explicitness and precision" of the instructions
[@singer_variables_1982 194]; the less ambiguous the rules are, the more
reliable the outcome will be. 

If something is left implicit in the coding instructions for example, or if the
observational matter is so complex or diverse that it cannot reasonably be
"encapsulated" in the measurement scale, the measurements will be less reliable
[@douglass_measuring_2018 192]. When clerks assigned with collecting data
encounter ambiguous situations where common sense must be applied to resolve
between categories, or to determine the inclusion or exclusion of an
observation, the decision made is not made within $f$, and thus creates an
additional source of variance [@stone_general_1966 62]. 

However, it is important to be aware of the fact that simpler and more rigid
rules will very likely result in less valid data [@sundberg_systematic_2011
99], especially in cases where the material to be structured is inherently
complex, or ambiguous. A balance must be found in every case.

## Computerization

A useful insight that is gained from the formalization of a data-making process
as being a process of mapping inputs to some output using a pre-defined
procedure is that data making is a process that is favourable to automation.
Computers, unimaginative and diligent, excel at performing such routinized
operations, and have been considered for such task since the very early days of
electronic computing [see @hunt_experiments_1966].

Data quality largely depends on the definition and execution of the
data-creation process. This raises the question: Do some approaches to
data-creation inherently lead to higher data quality? Comparing approaches in
terms of data quality reveals that there are salient differences that might
greatly affect the quality of the data. In addition, practical differences,
such as the time and resources per data point, are also important. 

I will argue that computerizing a data-making process, that is, using a
computer to perform part of, or the entire process of transforming information
into structured data, will improve data quality, especially when compared to
data-production processes involving human judgment as part of measurement
process. I will attempt to demonstrate this in the final chapter of this
thesis.

There are three facts about the way computers operate that drive this
improvement in data quality: First, computers follow given algorithms
unerringly. Second, computer algorithms can be scrutinized and reproduced post
factum. Third, algorithms are executed extremely quickly. 

### Reliability

The measurement part of data-making is a schematic process of applying
instructions to a given set of indicators to produce data. While it is
certainly possible to perform high-quality coding using human coders, who
follow instructions when comprehending information material, "coders are humans
even when they are asked to act like computers" [@krippendorff_content_2004
127]. Human error is inevitable [@cioffi-revilla_introduction_2017 103], and
is, as mentioned, exacerbated by complex and ambiguous instructions. The
error-inducing effects of fatigue and boredom that arise from protracted coding
of large amounts of data [@salehyan_best_2015 108] are also avoided when using
computers rather than people for the repetitive task of applying instructions
to raw data. 

When a computer applies a procedure to some raw data, the procedure is executed
unerringly, yielding results with no random variation. This is a crucial
difference between the way computers and humans cognize: For better or worse,
humans inevitably err when following instructions, while the reliability of the
execution of a computer program is nearly absolute [@stone_general_1966 12]. 

The fact that computers are thorough and unimaginative in performing tasks,
while not making them particularly suited for developing typologies or
reasoning about complex ideas, makes them ideal when it comes to the repetitive
application of instructions. As I have shown here, data creation involves both
kinds of reasoning; the development of concepts and operationalizations, and
the schematic observations according to the operationalization. The latter task
is ideally suited for automation, since it should involve little to no further
abstract reasoning.

Traditionally, reliability is affected by the complexity of the coding
instructions; the easier something is to measure and code, the more reliable
the data will be [@sundberg_systematic_2011 99]. Complex instruction that
demand much of the coder creates fatigue, and the need for commonsensical
disambiguation creates bias. These "fluctuations" do not, however, enter into
the process when a computer is used [@stone_general_1966 12].

For a computer, simple and complex instructions are equally difficult to
execute, but not equally difficult to define. When using computers to code, one
might say that the difficulty of measuring something instead affects the
resultant validity, or rather, the chance of measuring a concept correctly. The
development and scrutiny of the coding procedures, or rather the
operationalization, for a computerized data-making effort, is very important.

### Openness

While the schematic part of data-creation is suited for computerization, it is
important to emphasize the importance of human intelligence in defining and
managing the data-generating process. The importance of mindful and correct
definitions and operationalization does not diminish with computerization, but
arguably becomes even more important, as the volume of data that can be
produced and disseminated is greatly increased. Thus, with the opportunities
for creating vast amounts of data, ensuring operational validity and discussion
about the concepts that underlie the data becomes extremely important. 

While a justified critique of automated methods of information extraction is
that they tend to sacrifice validity for high reliability
[@bratberg_tekstanalyse_2017 120], I would argue that the combination of
efficiency and openness inherent in computing could rather facilitate the
development of more valid, and importantly, validateable measures, since they
allow for a much more detailed level of critique of data-creation projects: 

While computers cannot help in defining correct operationalizations and
conceptualizations, the fact that the operationalizations must be explicitly
detailed [@stone_general_1966 12], and might also be made open, means that
mindful use of data is made easier. The computer will not help with the
development of operationalizations, but the detailed scrutiny of the
operationalization, or even testing the effect of different operationalizations
on the resulting data, and conclusions drawn from such data, might contribute
positively to such discussions. This is made easier when coding with
computers, since in addition to being open, the application of the procedures
is extremely cost-efficient. 

### Resources

The running costs of a computerized data collection effort, both in terms of
time and money, are very low. While the initial investment in hardware and in
the development of software might be substantial, the result is extremely
efficient. This has two important implications: Firstly, more data can
realistically be produced, no longer limited by arbitrary financial boundaries.
Secondly, data can be coded and recoded extremely quickly, making it more
feasible to assess a given operationalization by comparison.

Experiences with automatic coding have shown substantial cost reductions:
According to calculations by @schrodt_automated_2013 [26], coding 3 million
data points from 26 million records with the TABARI automated coder takes about
6 minutes, while the same work would require about 500 000 man-hours of manual
coding. While the development of TABARI took a substantial amount of time and
resources, once it is designed, the inclusion of new source material, and the
continuous production of near real-time data is possible.
